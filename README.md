# Maya-launcher
Two .bat files that let you choose if you want to launch the 'Render set up' or 'Render layers version' of Maya.

# Set up
Copy the files where you maya preferences are, ex: C:\Users\< User name >\Documents\maya\2019\prefs 
Create two shortcuts on your desktop, link the corresponding icons to your shortcuts.

# How does it work?
The .bat check the value of this argument  '-iv "renderSetupEnable" ' and change it, if necesseray, in the config file prior to the launch of Maya. 

# Why ?
Convenient when you work on different projects so you do not have to restart Maya when you realized you are in the wrong environement.
